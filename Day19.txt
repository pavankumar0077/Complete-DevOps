To find which service running on which port
Ex: Jenkins

ps -ef | grep jenkins 
------------------------
Will show on which port jenkins is running 


Befault AWS will bot allow all the port to run like allowing the traffic from any port is not allowed 
Instance details -- Security -- Security groups -- Edit inbound rules 
---> Add rule
-- Customemr TCP port range anywhere 

IN JENKINS WE HAVE TO FOLLOW NEW APPROACH THAT IS 
Docker as agents

Add docker pipeline plugin and use docker when their is requirement
-- Cost saving
-- No need to change dependencies
-- images are available in docker hub
