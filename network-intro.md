## ================================= NETWORK ==========================

1) LAN - LOCAL AREA network -- Connected to the network and each other (EX: HOME)
2) IP -- specific location (logical address)
3) Switch -- connects devices within same network in Local area network
4) Router -- A router is a networking device that forwards data packages between "DIFFERENT" commputer networks from LAN to Outside internet
5) SUBNET - Sub network defines your Local area network Range
6) ANY network needs 3 thinngs -- IP, SUBNET, GATEWAY
7) Gateway -- IP address of the ROUTER 
8) ![image](https://github.com/pavankumar0077/Complete-DevOps/assets/40380941/f6d5b1de-4129-4bbf-b916-636b60863273)
9) Wiki - Network address translation (NAT) is a method of remapping an
IP address while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.
10) fIREWALL - Set of passive rules to protect network from unauthorized access
11) ![image](https://github.com/pavankumar0077/Complete-DevOps/assets/40380941/150d10e0-c6b4-474a-9ca9-f872870cf117)
12) DMZ -- If any request comes from adhoc devices it passes to router and it sends to DMZ
13) a DMZ or demilitarized zone is a subnetwork that contains and exposes a DEVICE
to an untrusted, network such as the Internet.
14) Port Forwarding redirects a communication request from one address and port numbas
combination to another while the packets are traversing a network gateway.
such as a router or firewall

## =================================== NETWORK TROUBLESHOOTING Command ==========================
```
1- ifconfig
```
IF we want to see where all the network interfaces are available ``` cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ ```
ifdown and ifup is used to donw and up the network
```
2- ifup etho
```
ifdown lo (lo is look back)
```
3- ifdown etho
4- ping 8.8.8.8
```
ping -c 5 8.8.8.8
```
5- traceroute 8.8.8.8
```
particular routes, gateway and all the hops
```
6- netstat
```
netstat -tunlp == to check open ports, routes, gateways 
```
7- dig www.google.com
```
We get CNAME, server info and etc
```
8- nslookup
```
nslookup www.google.com
canonical name, name and address
```
9- route
```
route -n == gateway ip address
```
10- host (host -t mx ServerGyan.com)
```
it will find all associated ip with our domain
```
11- arp -e
```
arp -e === Hardware info
```
12- ethtool
```
It prints the info of interface of lan card
```
13- hostname
```
hostname -I
```
14- Ð¿map
```
sudo install nmap -y
ip -r 
namep -A <ip-address> == From local machine we can check the remote server ip address like what are the ports are using there
```
15- ip
```
ip r -- ip adddress source and etc info
```
16- ss
```
socket status 
ss -ant == open listening on this ip address, ports and etc
```
17- tracepath
```
tracepath 8.8.8.8 == how it is reaching the ip address all the steps
```
18- ipref
```
sudo apt install iperf
iperf -c <particular-ip-address> 
```
19 tcpdump
```
tcpdump == all the traffic we are receving
tcpdump -i eth0
```
20- telnet
```
sudo apt install telnet
Connectivity check from one OS to other OS
```
