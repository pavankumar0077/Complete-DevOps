Git Branching Strategy
========================
Branch == It is sepration 

Master
Feature
Release


If you want to Delivery your code to customer then we create a Relase branch
-- Why we use release branch why not master
-- Be'coz master is kept for active development
================================================
Release == build == ship to customer
Master == is kept for active development, It should be up to date
Hot Fix branch == Quick fix, tested then moved to release and master branch both
